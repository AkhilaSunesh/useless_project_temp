# ThengaKola - Thenga Undo (തേങ്ങാ കൊല) 🎯
> *"തേങ്ങ വീഴും മുമ്പേ, കൊല അറിയാം"* (Know the Thenga before the Kola!)

Actual Repo: https://github.com/AkhilaSunesh/useless_project_temp (ente thanne)

## Basic Details
### Team Name: WannaBeInUndoUniverse

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Akhila Sunesh

### Project Description
ThengaKola is an AI-powered, mock Kerala government public safety hazard portal that detects individual coconuts on palm trees and calculates whether they possess enough ballistic kinetic energy to fracture a human skull. Complete with real YOLOv11 computer vision, Kerala district hazard radars, historical coconut crime registries, and the citizen self-reporting portal **"Thenga Undo?" (തേങ്ങാ ഉണ്ടോ?)**.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
**God’s Own Country has a very special problem.**

Kerala, the *“land of coconuts,”* is facing a coconut shortage. And the few that remain? **Avaru oru rakshayum illa.** 🥥

While people enjoy their **chaaya** or **uchayurakkam**, there’s always one question:

> **“Innu thenga thalayil veezhumo?”**

Cars, rooftops, and unsuspecting humans are constantly under attack from these **high-altitude husked missiles**.

Because in Kerala, you never know **eppo thenga veezhum!**
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A state-of-the-art Two-Stage Neural Threat Detector & Public Grievance Matrix! 
Users simply take a photo of any suspicious tree bunch. Our system localizes every coconut, crops and classifies ripeness, computes terminal drop velocity ($v = \sqrt{2gh}$) and cranial impact Joules ($KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$), assigns a Threat Level (*Low*, *Moderate*, *Lethal*, or *Code Red*), and pre-fills an official police FIR or downloadable **Tree Safety Clearance Certificate**. And for citizens without a camera, the **"Thenga Undo?"** census lets them self-report their backyard coconut headcount directly into the Kerala Hazard Radar!

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (Strict 4-Color Kerala Palette), JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js, Python 3
- **Frameworks / APIs**: 
  - Roboflow Hosted Inference REST API (Server-side proxy)
  - YOLOv11 Bunch Localization (`coconut-bunch-detection/11`)
  - Coconut Maturity Classification (`coconut-maturity-detection/6`)
- **Libraries**:
  - Web Audio API (procedural alert sirens & shutter sound synthesis)
  - HTML5 Canvas API (tactical HUD bounding boxes, crosshairs & image cropping)
  - Python `roboflow` & `Pillow` (offline data validation & asset pipeline)
- **Tools**:
  - Google Antigravity IDE (Agentic AI Pair Programmer)
  - Node.js `http` & `fs` custom backend with `.env` secret management

---

## Implementation

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tengakola.git
cd tengakola

# Optional: Install Roboflow python SDK if running offline validation scripts
pip install roboflow pillow
```

### Environment Configuration (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (protected by `.gitignore`):
```env
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=your_roboflow_api_key_here
ROBOFLOW_LOCALIZATION_MODEL=coconut-bunch-detection/11
ROBOFLOW_MATURITY_MODEL=coconut-maturity-detection/6
PORT=3000
```

### Run
```bash
# Start the secure backend server with Roboflow proxy & live static frontend
node server.js
```
Open your browser and navigate to: **`http://localhost:3000`**
